## Control statement

Control statements are an essential part of any programming language, including Java. These statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your program based on certain conditions or criteria.

There are three main types of control statements in Java: conditional statements, loop statements, and branching statements.

# Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. The two main conditional statements in Java are `if` and `switch`. The `if` statement checks a boolean expression and executes a block of code if the expression is true. The `switch` statement checks a variable or expression against a list of possible values and executes the corresponding block of code.

# Loop Statements

Loop statements allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. The three main loop statements in Java are `while`, `do-while`, and `for`. The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition. The `for` loop is a more specialized loop that provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values or a collection of objects.

# Branching Statements:

Branching statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your program by jumping to a different location in your code. The two main branching statements in Java are `break` and `continue`. The `break` statement terminates the current loop or switch statement and transfers control to the statement immediately following the terminated statement. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and jumps to the next iteration.

Using these control statements in your Java programs can help you create more sophisticated and flexible code that can respond to different conditions and criteria. By mastering these statements, you can create more powerful and effective programs that can solve a wide range of problems.

I hope this helps you can use other resources like stackoverflow or google for the syntax of the controls statement for more understanding. Thanks
