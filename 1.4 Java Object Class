In Java, the `Object` class is a fundamental class that serves as the root of the class 
hierarchy. Every class in Java is a direct or indirect subclass of the `Object` class. 
This means that the `Object` class provides a common set of methods and properties that are
available to all Java classes.

The `Object` class defines several important methods that can be used by any Java object. 
Some of the most commonly used methods include:

* `equals()`: This method checks whether two objects are equal in value. By default, this method
   checks whether the two objects have the same memory address, but it can be overridden in a 		
   subclass to provide a custom comparison.

* `hashCode()`: This method returns a hash code value for the object. The hash code is a unique
   integer value that is used by many Java classes to identify objects in collections and other
   data structures.

*  `toString()`: This method returns a string representation of the object. By default, this
    method returns the name of the class followed by the object's memory address, but it can be 
    overridden in a subclass to provide a custom string representation.

*  getClass(): This method returns the runtime class of the object. This can be useful for 	
   performing runtime type checks and for obtaining metadata about the object's class.

In addition to these methods, the Object class also provides a few other useful methods, 
such as wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(), which can be used for synchronization and thread 
management.

Overall, the Object class is an essential part of the Java class hierarchy and provides a 
common set of methods and properties that can be used by any Java object. 
By understanding and using these methods, you can create more powerful and flexible Java
programs.
