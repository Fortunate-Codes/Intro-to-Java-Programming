## Java Networking

Java Networking provides classes and interfaces to communicate over a network. It includes the ability to connect to remote hosts, send and receive data, and work with protocols like TCP, UDP, and HTTP.

The key classes and interfaces for networking in Java are:

`Socket`: A client-side endpoint for communicating with a server using a TCP connection.
`ServerSocket`: A server-side endpoint for listening for incoming TCP connections.
`DatagramSocket`: A socket for sending and receiving UDP datagrams.
`InetAddress`: Represents an IP address.
`URL`: A uniform resource locator, used to identify a resource on the internet.
`URLConnection`: Represents a connection to a URL, and provides methods for reading and writing data.

Here's an example of how to use Java Networking to connect to a web server and download a web page:

//////////////// CODE ////////////

import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class WebPageDownloader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a URL object for the web page to download
            URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com/");
            
            // Open a connection to the web server
            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            
            // Set the request method to GET
            conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
            
            // Read the response from the server
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));
            String line;
            while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            in.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

//////////////// CODE //////////////////

In this example, we create a `URL` object for the web page we want to download, and open a `HttpURLConnection` to connect to the server. We set the request method to `GET`, which is the default method for retrieving data from a web server. We then use a `BufferedReader` to read the response from the server line by line, and print it to the console.

Java Networking can also be used to create server-side applications, such as web servers or chat servers. To do this, you would use classes like `ServerSocket` and `Socket` to listen for incoming connections, and then use I/O streams to communicate with clients.
